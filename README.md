# __TRENDVERSE__

This is a project made for my MLOps course in which I perform trend forecasting on Instagram Data. 

## __STACK__

The model used was Prophet - in addition, Docker, AWS, DVC, MLFlow and Airflow was a part of our stack. 

### __GOAL__

The goal of this project was to examine forecasts of views on different forms of media (e.g. reels) on different categories such as Beauty and more. Furthermore, users can also view the top 'n' number of views for each category and media type as well.
